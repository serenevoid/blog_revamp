Have you ever wondered how your inbox get cluttered with lots of spam emails when
you don't remember giving your mail ID to the spam senders? I started having this
thought after I created my first mail ID and I started getting random emails out
of the blue. It was amusing at first but it became an annoyance soon. My personal
email inbox is still very cluttered and I wish I knew about email plus addressing
earlier so that I could've maintained my inbox in a better way.

## Plus Addressing

### What is it?
> Plus addressing or subaddressing is an industry-defined way to support dynamic,
disposable recipient email addresses.

This is the actual definition of the term. But in simple terms, it is a way to have
multiple temporary email address which you can map to your mail inbox by modifying
the actual mail ID a little with a `+` sign and a tag.

For example, if your mail ID is `robertkiyosaki@gmail.com`, you can append the mail ID
with `+<some_tag>` while you register somewhere online. The content including and after
the `+` sign will be removed by the email service provider when a mail is sent to 
that subaddress. So if they send a mail to `robertkiyosaki+pinterest@gmail.com`, 
your mail inbox will recieve the mail but with the recipient address as the subaddress.

### What can it be used for?

This feature can be used to subscribe to different services online like newsletters
or to create accounts. This way you will know who sold your data to the spammers.
There is an industry revolving around this data matching where companies match
their user's addresses to see which user uses which all services. Adding more
subaddresses will not prevent your data from being stolen but it will make their
jobs harder to some extend.

This can also be used to keep your inbox clutter free. You can search the recipient
address as the subaddress and remove every mail to that address while housekeeping
your inbox.

This also allows you to add a virtual classification of the online services you are
subscribed to.

### Does this mean you can create infinite subaddresses you can use?

Well, yes. You can create any number of unique subaddresses that you can use to
sign up in all the websites. But most online services implement precautions to
prevent you from creating infinite accounts using this subaddressing. They keep
a trimmed version of your subaddress in their database and match your new subaddress
with it. This way, you can still use the subaddressing feature without exploiting it.

### Is it secure?

Creating subaddresses doesn't guarantee online privacy since anyone who receives the
subaddress can easily get the real address by trimming off the tag part and use it
for spam or phishing campaign or to match with other data breaches. So it doesn't
provide the same privacy you get when creating a separate email account for your
subscriptions.

But when you use this to create accounts with the subaddress, it won't be converted
to the real address. So hackers will now need to know both the password and the
subaddress you used to create an account in order to hack it.

There is this problem of remembering all the subaddresses that you have used to
log in to different services. You can always use a password manager to store them.

### Conclusion

Email subaddressing is a simple but very useful feature everyone should use to
add an extra layer of security to your online privacy.

I was back in high school when I came across this quote.

> Jack of All Trades. Master of none.

I was curious about what this meant. But at that age, I was dumber than I am today.
I thought it was not good to keep your knowledge scattered instead of focusing 
on one thing alone. How am I going to get better or gain expertise in one thing? 

Most of us have not heard the full quote. And that is why people tend to think that 
being a master of none is a bad thing.

You cannot be better in life with just one skill. What you need is the collective 
knowledge of several skills. 

To succeed, learn as many related skills as you can. Get a habit of digging  
deep into your curiosities. Start thinking out of the box. And most importantly, 
make sure you enjoy doing it. You do not need to excel in all of them. Just gain 
expertise in your field but keep familiarised with the other fields so that if 
required, you can take it up on your own instead of finding someone else to do 
the work for you. This mentality will help you shine in your career as well as 
help you grow as an individual. 

Keep Digging.

Stay Curious.

And always have fun.

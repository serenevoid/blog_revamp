When I started my career as a developer, I was asked to install VSCode and start
learning the concepts of programming. I was happy with it. It was the perfect 
text editor for anyone who was a beginner.

> Well, it is insanely popular for its ease of use.

Slowly I started learning its shortcut keys and features to make myself more
productive. It was working. I was gettings faster with VSCode. I still remember 
the day when I learned about multiple cursors in VSCode and other code editors.
It was mind-blowing. I used it more and more.

And that was the time when I started to watch twitch streams about software 
development. I came across this [streamer](https://www.twitch.tv/ThePrimeagen) 
who was building stuff with a very familiar text editor interface. I understood 
it was VIM. But I was awestruck seeing him navigate through the code. 
It was lightning fast. I couldn't even see how he moved through it even when he 
was presenting his keyboard with a camera.

I have used VIM before and I didn't like it. It had a steeper learning curve and 
I always felt I was so slow using it. But after watching him, I was convinced to 
try it out again. I wanted to spend more time and learn this amazing way of navigating
inside a codebase. I saw that as an investment because I could see myself using 
VIM motions more and more.

So one fine day at work, I decided its time for me to switch to VIM. I installed 
it on my work system and started using that instead of using VSCode. Well, it was 
a mistake. I was so slow and irritated when things got slow. I was not that productive 
that day just because I was battling the text editor instead of doing actual work.

For the next whole week, I completed vimtutor twice, tried some vim motion 
exercises which I found online, and started writing and editing simple notes with it.
I even tried out using vim plugins and they helped in making editing more 
comfortable.

Finally, I decided to try it out at work again. But this time, I was prepared. 
I had my vim config ready to be used at work, a set of plugins that I thought would 
be useful for programming. I even included [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)
which helped with code completion just like in VSCode so that I won't try to quit 
very soon just like I did the last two times.

I gotta admit. This time it was different. I was very comfortable with this new 
workflow. I still couldn't say VIM was better than VSCode but it was very comfy 
just like how VSCode was before. But it changed soon. I became faster in 
codebase navigation, text editing, and overall developer experience. I was enjoying 
it a lot.

It was at that point that I was confident enough to uninstall VSCode from my system.
I did that and I knew I'll never regret this decision. Well I switched from VIM 
to [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) but never had to go back to VSCode or other non-modal 
text editors.

All this is what I learned and felt when I started using VIM. This post is not 
intended to say VIM is better or greater than VSCode in general. At the end of 
the day, it all depends on the preference of the user. If you feel like you are 
a person who doesn't want to spend time learning to use a new text editor and 
configure it, then VSCode and other out-of-the-box editors might be well suited 
for you. But if you are a person like me who likes trying out and tinkering with 
new things, and building personalized tools, then I recommend VIM.

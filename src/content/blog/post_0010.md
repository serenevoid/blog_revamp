Linux, the hobby project of a college student, is responsible for moving the whole 
world forward. The Linux operating system is everywhere around you. 
In your smartphones, smart cars, internet servers, smart home appliances and so 
on. It also runs most of the internet and the top 500 supercomputers in the world.

## What is GNU/Linux?
One does not simply say Linux is an OS. Linux is the kernel of the operating system 
that interacts with the computer hardware. The GNU Toolchain is a set of tools that 
form the actual operating system which is why we call it GNU/Linux.

## Why use Linux?
Well, there are many reasons for me to like linux more than any other operating 
systems.
- Linux OS won't cost you money unless you are using certain enterprise distributions 
which provide special tools.
- It is Free and Open Source which enables other developers to look into the source 
code and develop together. Any form of malware in the source code can be detected by 
at least one of the thousands of developers. So it's mostly malware free unless you 
decide to do something stupid on your own.
- It helps you configure anything as you please. Do you want to remove a system 
software? Sure. Go ahead.
- You can learn about tools you use in linux and hack it according to your needs.
- The more you learn about linux, the more you learn about how a computer works.
- Installing software is more uniform than in other operating systems. You have 
a package manager available which can install almost all your needed software if they 
are available for linux. Even if it might look scary at first, it's very easy and 
convenient once you learn to use it.
- With linux, you have the freedom of choice. You choose how your system should be. 
No one should decide that for you.

## What are Distros?

GNU/Linux has different "flavours" called distributions or distros available to 
match different people's needs. These have been made by different groups of people 
according to their common tastes. Some people find it fun to jump between different 
distros from time to time. 

I have been a small distro hopper myself. These are the distros which I have tried 
so far.
 - Ubuntu
 - Xubuntu
 - Debian
 - Manjaro
 - Arch Linux
 - Void Linux
 - Fedora

Currently, I am still using Fedora's Server edition. I used it to set up a minimal 
install similar to arch and then built my system on top of that. I'll create another 
post to describe my desktop configuration and the software that I use.

## Is it worth it?
Absolutely. If you are a person who loves tinkering with software and enjoys building 
things, you'll love linux and it's freedom. It's a never-ending journey where you 
discover new software and tools which make life easier.

Installing software has always been the same on windows machines from my childhood days.
You download a setup file and execute it, it shoots up a prompt, asking for the
installation folder, you confirm the configuration details and finally the software
gets installed and the prompt is closed.

This was became the default way of installing things to the OS for me. This was before
I was introduced to the world of linux OS. I remember watching tutorials on youtube
where people installed softwares from the command line in thier linux machines.
I used to think how inconvenient it was because you have to remove all these *enchantments*
just for getting some programs to run. But somehow after daily driving linux for
a few weeks, I started to love the commandline and the way it installs the files
without much user interventions.
